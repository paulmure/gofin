# gofin
## What is this?
gofin is a cached financial database. The user need to set up a local mysql server, and can perform various tasks such as crawling the stock market and logging stock prices with set time intervals.

## What is this *not*?
gofin is not intented to be used as a data analysis tool. In fact, gofin does not even support retrieving data from the database. We believe those tasks are better done with other dynamic languages like python.
